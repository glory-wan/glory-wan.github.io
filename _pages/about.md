<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a visiting student at ShanghaiTech University, conducting research in the [AMNR group](https://www.amnrlab.org/) under the joint supervision of [Prof. Song Liu](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/liusong/main.htm), who is expert in the field of ultrasonic robotics, micro/nano robotics in the ShanghaiTech Automation and Robotics Center, and [Prof. Hu Su](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~suhu), who is expert in the field of machine vision, robotic control and non-contact manipulation Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences). I received my B.E. degree from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, advised by [Prof. Jun Liu](https://faculty.cqupt.edu.cn/junliu/zh_CN/index.htm), who is expert in the field of computer vision, blockchain, and big data security.

## Research interests

My research interests include computer vision, embodied intelligence, and multimodal large models. My earlier work focused on low-level vision tasks (e.g., low-light image enhancement), while my current research explores 3D reconstruction and embodied intelligence.
